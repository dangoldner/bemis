    "I'm Dan — trained in physical oceanography, experienced in state-space modeling, finite difference methods, and data science, but new to investment theory. I'm working through Chris Bemis's *Portfolio Statistics and Optimization* (August 2023) to build understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Book structure**: Chapters are split into separate dialogs (ch_1.ipynb, ch_2.ipynb, etc.). Also available:\n",
    "- `./spoiler.md` — short digest of each chapter's point and how they form the book's arc\n",
    "- `./bib.ipynb` — bibliography\n",
    "\n",
    "**Arc**: The book builds from statistical foundations (distributions, covariance) through regression and optimization theory to Mean-Variance Optimization and coherent risk measures. Chris emphasizes using CAPM and Fama-French as *interpretive* tools rather than prescriptive models, given non-stationarity and fat tails in real markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ch 1 covered**: EMH, systemic vs idiosyncratic risk, CAPM (β as market sensitivity, α as excess return), Fama-French (adding size and value factors), and MVO setup. Key theme: models are useful for interpretation and comparison, but their stationarity assumptions are violated in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ch 2 covered**: CDFs, PDFs, moments (mean, variance, skew, kurtosis), percentiles. Normal, log-normal, and Student *t* distributions — with emphasis on how real equity returns exhibit fat tails and asymmetry that the normal badly misses (837,128× underestimate of 6σ events!). Student *t* with ν=5 is a pragmatic alternative. Multivariate extensions (joint distributions, covariance matrices, independence). Weak Law of Large Numbers, Central Limit Theorem, and unbiased estimators.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Ch 2 insight**: Two toy models illustrate diversification. Model 1 (iid returns) suggests you can diversify away *all* risk. Model 2 (returns = β×market + idiosyncratic) shows you can only diversify away idiosyncratic risk — systematic risk remains. This motivates the passive investing view (\"just own the market\") and sets up the question: what justifies active management?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ch 3 covered**: Covariance as an inner product (giving Cauchy-Schwarz bounds on correlation). CAPM revisited: β = ρ(σ_r/σ_m), derived via inner product machinery. Key insight: correlation measures *linear* dependence only — a perfect quadratic relationship can show ρ ≈ 0 if positive and negative branches cancel.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Copulas**: Sklar's theorem lets you separate any joint distribution into (1) a copula (pure dependence structure in [0,1]ᴺ space) and (2) arbitrary marginals. The probability integral transform (F(X) ~ U[0,1]) is the bridge. Gaussian copula infamously underestimated tail dependence in 2008 CDO crisis — Student-t copulas better capture \"extremes cluster\" behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Eigendecomposition of Σ**: Eigenportfolios (eᵢ'X) are uncorrelated and variance-ranked (Var = λᵢ). This is just PCA on returns. Empirically: one dominant eigenvalue (the market), a few sector factors, then a bulk of near-zero eigenvalues that are mostly estimation noise (random matrix theory). Ill-conditioning (large λ_max/λ_min) causes optimization to blow up on those noisy directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Ch 3 insight**: The largest eigenportfolio is a proxy for \"the market\" — lending empirical support to simple CAPM. Correlations are unstable (regime-dependent) and spike in crises, which copula models must account for or fail catastrophically.\n",
    "\n",
    "**My approach**: I'm comfortable with the calculus and linear algebra; I'm here for the finance intuition and the book's arc toward coherent risk measures. I skipped the Ch 2 exercises (PDF integration drills) since later chapters use distributions as tools rather than deriving them."

    "## Ordinary Least Squares\n",
    "\n",
    "Our work in Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) begins with the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). Fitting the parameters of the model to historical data is reduced to a calculus problem and an associated assumption about so-called idiosyncratic error terms. After establishing the methodology for calculating the CAPM parameters, we look at the implications of the model, giving testable hypotheses which we examine with market data. We find, as in Fama-French [10], for example, that these hypotheses are not borne out in the market, however.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach used to fit a CAPM model is justified through the establishment of the method of maximum likelihood, which, more generally justifies our approach in OLS. Our treatment of the subject is principally mathematical, relying in large part on the properties of projection operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "We discuss and derive from three main assumptions (here identified as the Gauss-Markov assumptions and a sometimes-accompanying distributional assumption) the distributional properties of estimators of regression parameters. These distributions allow us to determine confidence intervals for our estimators as well as establish so-called null hypothesis tests [18, 6]. Our primary test statistics will be the *t*-test and *F*-test, which we build from first principles. The latter test statistic lends itself to model selection criteria, and we build upon this in our presentation of forward selection, backward elimination, and stepwise regression techniques.\n",

This is not a model derived from observations and relationships in the market, but based on assumptions of how a market ought to perform. We prefer a somewhat nontraditional definition, relating a given security's adjusted returns to the market as in (4.4). The allowance for nonzero  $\\alpha$  has serious implications, though, which we address momentarily. The other major defining features of the model are obtained rather than assumed in this formulation, however. This intersection of parsimony and flexibility is hard to pass up.\n",

    "This last line is intimately involved with the Efficient Market Hypothesis [28, 2]. In the case that we have a fully explanatory model, a nonzero  $\\alpha$  should be precluded in an efficient market. Any alternative allows for securities which give opportunities for risk free excess returns. Consider the case where  $\\alpha > 0$ . A portfolio,  $\\Pi$ , with returns  $r_\\Pi$ , long one unit of the security with returns  $r$  and short  $\\beta$  units of the market will have an expected return\n",

We forgo requiring a proof of this until we have established more optimization techniques as the current applications find a direct and amenable analogue there.\n",
    "\n",
    "We say that such a portfolio provides an opportunity for *statistical arbitrage*: positive returns are expected in excess of those explained by selected factors. In our current model, the only factor (usually called a *risk factor*) is the market proper. A particular type of statistical arbitrage often claimed by academics and practitioners alike involves cross-sectional comparisons of fundamental or technical data; e.g., comparing ratios like earnings before interest and taxes over enterprise value at a given time for a set of stocks under consideration (we will have a more formal treatment of these terms in a following chapter). We will call these types of statistical arbitrage opportunities *anomalies*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Empirically, the omission of  $\\alpha$  in (4.1) is a mistake. Equity anomalies abound. As such, we use (4.4) for the identification of anomalies rather than assume away their existence. Notice, however, that statistical arbitrage and anomalies are defined in relation to some model. The specification of that model, then, is critical in the assessment of perceived opportunities and statistical descriptions of any security or portfolio of securities. A consequence of the above is that one measure of a powerful descriptive model in the equity space is its ability to statistically identify an  $\\alpha$  of zero for many of the widely accepted and observed anomalies in the literature (as determined by models such as CAPM or its extensions).\n",
    "\n",
    "Practitioners will often refer to the  $\\alpha$  of a given security, portfolio, strategy, or idea. These references necessarily presuppose some underlying model description – oftentimes the assumed model is CAPM. Similarly,  $\\beta$  is also used as a descriptive characteristic for securities and portfolios alike. In practice, references to  $\\beta$  as such are made to the sensitivity to the market; i.e., CAPM- $\\beta$ ."

For now, however, we note that if the expected return of the market exceeds the risk free rate<sup>1</sup>,  $\\mathbb{E}(r)$ , is an increasing function of  $\\beta$ ,  $\\sigma_r$ , and correlation to the market. Where in studying the latter two cases empirically, care must be taken to control for correlation and  $\\sigma_r$ , respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may also solve for  $\\sigma_r$ , obtaining a similar result,\n",

    "\n",
    "As a result, controlling for  $\\beta$ , *idiosyncratic risk*,  $\\sigma_\\epsilon$ , is positively and monotonically related to higher returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already seen that systemic risk,  $\\sigma_m$ , cannot be reduced while idiosyncratic risk may be diversified away. This seems to be an apparent drawback to the model: the identification of idiosyncratic risk and return is diluted away by diversification, leaving on the market. We will see an elegant proof that ameliorates this concern on the surface—namely that the model gives preferential treatment to the market over any other security or portfolio. This proof, however, will explicitly state that all investors should be holders only of a risk free asset and the market, in varying proportion determined by their risk preferences. We postpone this proof until we have established Merton’s mean variance optimization problem.\n",

    "\n",
    "In every case above risk – as proxied by  $\\sigma_r$  – is directly proportional to expected returns. The implication of the CAPM model, then, and its interpretation within the framework of the Efficient Market Hypothesis, is that apparent excess returns are obtained by taking on risk.\n",

    "This is not borne out in practice, however. In fact, the equity market prices risk perversely: returns to higher volatility names *underperform* low volatility names. This feature seems to generalize when one encounters the value, momentum, accrual, and fraud anomalies, for instance. In each of these cases, portfolios of *a priori* preferable names outperform less desirable names, *and they do so with more attractive risk profiles*.\n",

    "### 4.5 Collinearity and the Condition Number\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this chapter we have required that the design matrix,  $X$ , be full rank, resulting in a nonsingular,  $X'X$ . We have also seen how the uncertainty in OLS parameter estimates is affected by this design matrix, specifically as the inverse,  $(X'X)^{-1}$  is critical to defining the variance of these estimates. In this section we examine some features of the OLS estimate through the lens of linear algebra. In particular, we ask what impact small changes in  $Y$  might have in the estimate,  $\\hat{\\beta}$ .\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach will be via the matrix norm defined in (3.26) and a related measure called the *condition number* of a matrix. Consider the linear system of equations\n",

    "$$Ax = b,$$\n",

    "We would like to understand how relative changes in  $b$ ,  $\\frac{||\\Delta b||}{||b||}$ , translate to relative changes in  $x$ ,  $\\frac{||\\Delta x||}{||x||}$ . Looking at the original system, we have\n",

    "\n",
    "Interpreting this result, we see that relative changes in  $b$  scaled by the *condition number* of  $A$  provide an upper bound for the resulting relative change in  $x$ . This bound may be made tighter, and in doing so, one may produce examples where the inequality gives an equality; i.e., there is no lower bound. This is slightly beyond the scope of what we provide here, however.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even so, (4.52) remains insightful. For, all things being equal, we might prefer a smaller condition number than a greater one. It is somewhat direct to\n",

    "\n",
    "The condition number of the design matrix  $X$ , then, is a direct measure of the sensitivity of the parameter estimate,  $\\hat{\\beta}$ . We say that a matrix is *ill-conditioned* if its condition number is very large, and *well conditioned* otherwise. In the context of collinearity and ordinary least squares, then, we see that variable selection is critical, and a preference for orthogonality over similarity generally obtains. Conversely, and in practice, identifying that a particular design matrix is ill-conditioned signals to the practitioner that their choice of predictors is in need of culling as one or more inputs are near some vector in the span of the remaining variables."
