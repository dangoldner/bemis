    "- `./spoiler.md` — short digest of each chapter's point and how they form the book's arc\n",
    "- `./bib.ipynb` — bibliography\n",
    "\n",
    "**Arc**: The book builds from statistical foundations (distributions, covariance) through regression and optimization theory to Mean-Variance Optimization and coherent risk measures. Chris emphasizes using CAPM and Fama-French as *interpretive* tools rather than prescriptive models, given non-stationarity and fat tails in real markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ch 1 covered**: EMH, systemic vs idiosyncratic risk, CAPM (β as market sensitivity, α as excess return), Fama-French (adding size and value factors), and MVO setup. Key theme: models are useful for interpretation and comparison, but their stationarity assumptions are violated in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ch 2 covered**: CDFs, PDFs, moments (mean, variance, skew, kurtosis), percentiles. Normal, log-normal, and Student *t* distributions — with emphasis on how real equity returns exhibit fat tails and asymmetry that the normal badly misses (837,128× underestimate of 6σ events!). Student *t* with ν=5 is a pragmatic alternative. Multivariate extensions (joint distributions, covariance matrices, independence). Weak Law of Large Numbers, Central Limit Theorem, and unbiased estimators.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Ch 2 insight**: Two toy models illustrate diversification. Model 1 (iid returns) suggests you can diversify away *all* risk. Model 2 (returns = β×market + idiosyncratic) shows you can only diversify away idiosyncratic risk — systematic risk remains. This motivates the passive investing view (\"just own the market\") and sets up the question: what justifies active management?\n",
    "\n",
    "**My approach**: I'm comfortable with the calculus and linear algebra; I'm here for the finance intuition and the book's arc toward coherent risk measures. I skipped the Ch 2 exercises (PDF integration drills) since later chapters use distributions as tools rather than deriving them."

    "Ok helpful. The model you used could arise if I had two binormal 2D populations (with the two different $\\rho$'s), but I didn't understand the difference and thought of them as one population (or I did understand but didn't care). It's not different than a 1D bi-modal - there's some case or regime variable that sets which of the two modes \"pertains\" to a given realization and if you don't understand that you just are surprised to find two modes and it starts you wondering what's going on.  \n",

    "Exactly. And that's precisely the financial relevance: the \"regime variable\" might be \"crisis vs. calm\" or \"risk-on vs. risk-off.\" In one regime assets move together (ρ > 0), in another they hedge each other (ρ < 0). Pool the data naively and you see ρ ≈ 0 overall — which badly misrepresents both regimes.\n",

    "Copulas are capable of modeling a considerable amount of information more than simple correlation. Even so, the applications that dominate the field involve using copula models to imbue marginal distributions with a given correlation structure.

    "Li's formula, however, is far more dangerous than Merton or Sharpe's. The model above, here told in generalities, but a rigorous treatment is not too much more involved, was used to estimate probabilities of joint defaults within pools of hundreds or even thousands of loans. The constant pairwise correlation is concerning, but the use of the normal distribution is even more so. Our previous analysis of the inability of the normal distribution to capture market extremes is apropos here as well.\n",

    "The ease of implementation lead to this copula-based model here being used to mint huge numbers of triple-A rated bonds (made up from tiered levels of\n",

    "\n",
    "Not only are correlations unstable (as we have already seen) and extreme events terribly likely, the CDO market (because of such great ratings by the ratings agencies) saw massive leverage. This was a recipe for disaster and culminated in the financial crisis of 2008. There were many people who could see this train-wreck coming far before it occurred, but in large part, the market did not. In effect, the market wasn’t efficient at pricing pairwise correlations; or, even worse, systemic crashes.\n",

    "Li has apparently been unavailable for comment since the crisis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with the above cautionary tale, we maintain that the powerful capability of modeling joint and marginal distributions separately is incomparable. Again, our emphasis is on interpretation and empiricism rather than on normative modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, we may propose uses for the copula approach along the lines of Meucci [24], suggesting to use a joint Student *t* copula with five degrees of freedom and flexible marginals, or various panic copulas which reflect the stylized features of asymmetry and increased correlation in a crisis we have noted previously. Such additions are not merely refinements to the approach presented in Li’s paper, but well thought out and natural implementations of a flexible model in a market with a few known attributes. The copula modeling approach – much like the percentile modeling in VaR and CVaR interpretations of risk – allows the practitioner to articulate a wide variety of views. As such, its maligned history will likely be short."

    "In Figure 3.3, an estimated covariance matrix was calculated monthly for a cross-section of the 50 largest stocks at the time by market cap. The covariance was calculated using 121 trailing weeks of returns. The largest  $N$  eigenvalues were chosen according to (3.25), with  $\\tau = 80\\%$ . A smoothed approximation, looking at the mean  $N_t$  for the trailing 18 months is shown as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout, no more than 18 eigenportfolios were needed to explain more than 80% of the total variance. This is a significant decrease from the original dimension of 50. Additionally, the figure shows that there was a steeped decrease in the number of eigenportfolios ‘explaining the market’ from the financial crisis through 2015 – only rebounding from the lows sometime in 2011. This effect is likely related to the various Quantitative Easing programs initiated by the Fed at the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may also ask how much of the total variance is explained by the eigenportfolio related to the largest eigenvalue. Figure 3.3 shows the time variation of the explanatory power of this eigenportfolio. We see again the significant upswing after the Financial Crisis, achieving levels of market coordination not seen in the preceding twenty years. While the adage that in a crisis correlations go to one is evidenced here (read the explanatory power of the largest eigenvalue increases significantly), the figure is also instructive, showing that the market is dynamic and that heretofore unseen influences like the Fed’s Qualitative Easing [12] can have significant and novel effects. However, we should note that these effects are interpretable – and perhaps even expected from the trained practitioner’s eye – using the mathematical edifice already in place and established here.\n",

    "\n",
    "Carrying this type of reasoning further, one may posit that if a necessary (but clearly not sufficient) condition for a bear market downturn is an uptick in the explanatory power of the largest eigenvalue, a crisis post 2015 would require a break in the elevated levels seen since 2008. There is minor evidence of this in the figure as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we may look at the distribution of eigenvalues in a manner similar to our previous analysis of daily log returns for various stocks. Figure 3.3 shows the empirical density of the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix as before available on 12/31/2007. As with our discussion of the distribution of daily log returns, certain stylized features emerge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Particularly, even with observations that are linearly independent, we see a peak of near-zero eigenvalues. In recent years, the tools of Random Matrix Theory (RMT) have been implemented in math finance to study this phenomenon. Authors like Bouchaud and Potters [4] present a methodology based on RMT to identify random, and hence noisy, eigenportfolios. Doing so seeks to modify the covariance (correlation) matrix to eliminate eigenportfolios with erroneously low contributions to risk. This effect is particularly important when considering mean-variance optimization.\n",

    "\n",
    "In addition to a large bulk of eigenvalues clustering around zero, we also note one very large eigenvalue – in this case, 2,745 times larger than the smallest eigenvalue, and 3.80 times larger than the second largest eigenvalue. This eigenvalue is documented as related to the market portfolio as in Avellaneda [1], but we cannot replicate these claims. However, we do note that the eigenportfolio for this eigenvalue very often has all positive entries (or, more accurately since eigenvectors are scalar independent, all entries share the same sign).\n",
    "\n",
    "The covariance structure of equity returns, then, allows for a broad classification wherein the market is often driven by a dominant market portfolio, orders of magnitude larger than the smallest eigenvalue. This smallest eigenvalue, in turn, lies amongst a bulk of very near zero eigenvalues that may be classified in a technical sense as random noise. Further, the effects of the largest eigenvalue are interpretable in a dynamic sense, accounting for time specific features of the market as such."
