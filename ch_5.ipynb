    "\n",
    "Certain useful properties of the gradient include that the gradient points in the direction of greatest increase for  $f$  (and as a corollary,  $-\\nabla f$  points in the direction of greatest decrease), and that  $\\nabla f(x)$  is tangent to the level curve of  $f$  at  $x$ .\n",

That is, the direction of greatest increase points in the direction of the gradient.\n",

    "Similarly, to find the direction which decreases  $f$  the most, we must choose  $\\theta$  so that  $\\cos\\theta = -1$ , giving that the direction of greatest decrease as  $-\\nabla f(x)$ .  $\\square$\n",
