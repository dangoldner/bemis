    "## Covariance Modifications\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as we may alter our particular risk measure, we may also focus directly on the covariance matrix. Of course, as a driver for the elliptical distributions we have seen, this may be an effort which has multiple avenues of impact; e.g., directly in the objective function in a mean-variance setting, or perhaps as the driver of returns in a mean-CVaR setting. In any event, the importance and centrality of the covariance in much of what we have covered should be clear. Furthermore, the difficulties surrounding the sample covariance matrix, in terms of estimation, variation through time, and as an input in an objective function of an optimization problem have been made clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we consider several modifications to the covariance matrix; all of which are biased estimators of the covariance, and rely on varying amounts of predefined structure. First, we will formally outline the so-called *factor model* approach. Here, structure is explicit and full. A similar modification relies on a combination of the sample and some factor model based estimator. Broadly, these are *shrinkage estimators*, and while the literature is very robust, we will focus on a small subset of these results. Finally, as we have seen that constrained mean-variance optimization generally outperforms its unconstrained counterpart, we present a modification to the covariance unifying these observations via a *constrained maximum likelihood* correspondence."

    "In addition to the single factor model of CAPM [22, 31], another very well-regarded factor model is the Fama-French extension to CAPM [10].

    "The particular method of construction of the time series for the common factors,  $h_t$  and  $v_t$ , may be seen in the original paper. Broadly, they are constructed via cross-sectional rank ordered portfolios, controlling for remaining factor exposures; viz.,  $h_t$  is determined as the average return (in the cross-section) of ‘small high value’ and ‘big high value’ minus the average return (again, in the cross-section) of ‘small low value’ and ‘big low value’, where ‘small’ and ‘big’ are with respect to the median market capitalization of the cross-section at that particular time.\n",

As an example of the distinction when fitting a time series regression, we will assume that  $\\text{Cov}(f_{k,t}, \\epsilon_{i,t}) = 0$  for all  $k$ ,  $t$ , and  $i$ .\n",

    "#### 10.4.1 Some Comments on Shrinkage\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically within this text, derivations of results take precedence, while in the establishment of the two example shrinkage targets above, results are shown without proof. These derivations, while direct, are outside the scope of this text; in particular, we have not covered distributional statements (including variance and covariance) for the general entries of a covariance matrix. However, the usefulness of the shrinkage estimator approach cannot be understated. Using historical return data, one may show that general mean-variance optimization problems result in more attractive risk-adjusted returns than, say, using the sample covariance matrix alone with its known inadequacies or any of several standard factor model based approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interested reader is urged to consult the original reference papers and pursue the statistical background necessary for a full treatment. Further, a generalization of the results shown here is possible, particularly in the identification of  $q$  above when  $\\Omega$  has a factor model structure as in (10.8), but this extension is left to the reader."

    "### 10.5 Constraints as Modifications to the Covariance\n",
    "\n",
    "Given any covariance matrix as input to a portfolio optimization problem, we have already seen that investors often impose constraints to forcibly yield portfolios that reflect *a priori* position and exposure requirements; viz., no shortsales, diversification, and particular style or sector exposures. Jagannathan and Ma identify the role of some example constraints in acting like a shrinkage estimator for the sample covariance [14]. In a word, they establish why *imposing the wrong constraints helps*.\n",

    "In this section, we extend the work of Jagannathan and Ma to the case of general constraints, with attention paid to the application of the method as a modifier in the sense of Black and Litterman [3]; i.e., as a way to express investor views via constraints to obtain modified means and covariances (either jointly or individually). In contrast to Black-Litterman, however, we allow for the expression of views as both excess expected returns as well as desired exposures.\n",
