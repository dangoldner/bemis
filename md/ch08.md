## Chapter 8

## Mean-Variance Optimization

We arrive finally at mean-variance optimization, a hallmark of modern portfolio theory, having established the statistical and optimization framework needed for a fairly full treatment. In this chapter, we will develop the standard framing for the problem and identify some of its most salient features such as the efficient frontier in mean-variance space. We will also prove a theorem – which, if true, would greatly reduce portfolio management complexity – called the mutual fund separation theorem. We will also establish the capital market line of mean-variance optimization and in so doing we will connect mean-variance optimization to the Capital Asset Pricing Model directly.

From the standard problem, we look at several variants, including Sharpe Ratio optimization, portfolio updates in a mean-variance optimal setting, and proving equivalency of maximizing returns under a quadratic constraint.

### 8.1 The Standard Problem

Merton's mean-variance optimization [22] equates investor risk with portfolio variance. That is, for stochastic returns,  $r \in \mathbb{R}^N$ , and fixed portfolio weights,  $w \in \mathbb{R}^N$ , the variance of the portfolio is given by  $\text{Var}(w'r) = w'\Sigma w$  with  $\Sigma = \text{Cov}(r)$ , and this quantity completely determines the risk an investor is taking. In its original formulation, minimizing variance is paired with a requirement of some expected return. Letting  $\mu = \mathbb{E}(r)$ , the linearity of expectation gives that the expected portfolio return is  $\mu'w$ .

For the present treatment, we will assume that  $r$  is linearly independent as defined previously; that is,  $\Sigma$  is positive definite.

We immediately arrive at Merton's original constrained optimization prob-

lem:

$$\begin{array}{l}\min_w \frac{1}{2} w' \Sigma w \\ \mu' w = \mu^* \\ 1' w = 1.\end{array}\tag{8.1}$$

Plainly, we see that we are minimizing risk (read variance) subject to an investor-specified required return,  $\mu^*$ , being achieved in expectation, and portfolio weights summing to one. Looking at the form of the objective and constraints, the optimization problem is classified as a *quadratic programming problem with linear constraints*. From our work in the previous chapter, we know that (8.1) has a unique solution obtained by looking at the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions (7.11), which are both necessary and sufficient.

In particular, the vanishing gradient of the Lagrangian and two feasibility constraints give a system of equations in  $w$ ,  $\lambda_1$ , and  $\lambda_2$ .

$$\Sigma w - \lambda_1 \mu - \lambda_2 1 = 0 \tag{8.2}$$

$$\mu' w = \mu^* \tag{8.3}$$

$$1' w = 1. \tag{8.4}$$

A system of equations in just  $\lambda_1$  and  $\lambda_2$  may be obtained by premultiplying (8.2) by  $\mu'$  and  $1'$ :

$$b\lambda_1 + a\lambda_2 = \mu^* \tag{8.5}$$

$$a\lambda_1 + c\lambda_2 = 1,$$

for choices of  $a$ ,  $b$ , and  $c$  which we leave to the reader. The resulting matrix equation is simply

$$\begin{pmatrix} b & a \\ a & c \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \lambda_1 \\ \lambda_2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \mu^* \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}, \tag{8.6}$$

which gives

$$\begin{aligned}\lambda_1^* &= \frac{c\mu^* - a}{d} \\ \lambda_2^* &= \frac{b - a\mu^*}{d}.\end{aligned}$$

where  $d = bc - a^2$  is the determinant of (8.6). Due to the positive-definiteness of  $\Sigma^{-1}$ ,  $d$  is positive (proof left to the reader).

From here, the optimal weights,  $w^*$ , are given by inverting  $\Sigma$  in (8.2) and using the analytic solutions for  $\lambda_1^*$  and  $\lambda_2^*$ ,

$$w^* = \frac{c\mu^* - a}{d} \Sigma^{-1} \mu + \frac{b - a\mu^*}{d} \Sigma^{-1} 1. \tag{8.7}$$

The variance of the portfolio is calculated by premultiplying (8.2) by  $w'^*$ . This gives

$$\begin{aligned}\mathrm{Var}(w'^* r) &= \lambda_1^* \mu^* + \lambda_2^* \\ &= \frac{c\mu^{*2} - 2a\mu^* + b}{d}.\end{aligned}\tag{8.8}$$

A scatter plot titled 'Efficient Frontier'. The x-axis is 'Volatility' (ranging from 0.1 to 0.15) and the y-axis is 'Expected Return' (ranging from 0.12 to 0.24). The plot shows a large number of red data points representing portfolios. A blue curve, representing the efficient frontier, bounds the upper right portion of the data points. A single green point is visible on the far left edge of the data.

We have, finally, that the variance of the optimal portfolio of (8.1) is a quadratic function of  $\mu^*$ , completely determined by  $\Sigma^{-1}$  and  $\mu$ . We now arrive at our first comment about the variety of specifications that the problem allows. That is, (8.1) provides a curve of solutions, parameterized by  $\mu^*$ , tracing out a parabola in volatility-return space. As of yet, we do not have a preference or a taxonomy for points on this curve, however. Looking at (8.8) gives us a preliminary insight. Namely, we may identify the minimum variance portfolio by taking the derivative with respect to  $\mu^*$ , giving

$$\frac{d\sigma_{w^*}^2}{d\mu^*} = \frac{2c\mu^* - 2a}{d},$$

where  $\sigma_{w^*}^2$  denotes the variance of the portfolio with weights  $w^*$ .

Doing so, we see that the variance function is minimized when

$$\mu^* = \frac{a}{c}. \tag{8.9}$$

We will denote this mean by  $\underline{\mu}$ . We call the portfolio with minimum feasible variance the *global minimum variance optimal portfolio*, or GMVO, and as

we shall see subsequently, the performance of these portfolios in our sample period is surprising relative to what the theory prescribes. Recalling our previous results on the variance anomaly, however, will give the astute reader some foreshadowing.

We may plot various portfolios in volatility-return space as in Figure 8.1. Notice that the curve of solutions parameterized by  $\mu^*$  – the so-called *efficient frontier* – provides a boundary for possible mean-variance optimal portfolios in volatility-return space, and, as (8.8) implies, the boundary is quadratic in expected returns.

Under the assumptions of the model (namely that risk is variance and reward is expected return), investors should, for a given level of risk tolerance (read variance), require as much reward (read expected return) as possible. Geometrically, this means that investors will draw a line vertically until they hit the efficient frontier for any specified level of risk, going up until they maximize return. Similarly, for a given level of required return, investors will draw a line horizontally until they arrive at the minimal variance portfolio with that same expected return.

From (8.8) we have that, for a given level of expected return,  $\mu^*$ ,

$$\sigma=\sqrt{\frac{c\mu^{*2}-2a\mu^*+b}{d}}.$$

Writing  $\mu^*$  as a function of  $\sigma$ , we have

$$\begin{aligned}d\sigma^2 &= c\mu^{*2}-2a\mu^*+b \\ 0 &= c\mu^{*2}-2a\mu^*+(b-d\sigma^2),\end{aligned}$$

which by the quadratic equation gives

$$\begin{aligned}\mu^* &= \frac{a}{c}\pm\frac{\sqrt{a^2-bc+d c\sigma^2}}{c} \\ &= \frac{a}{c}\pm\frac{\sqrt{d(c\sigma^2-1)}}{c}\end{aligned}$$

since  $d=bc-a^2$ . Now, since  $\mu=\frac{a}{c}$  is the return to the minimum variance portfolio, we have that the efficient frontier is given by

$$\mu^*=\mu+\frac{1}{c}\sqrt{d(c\sigma^2-1)}.\tag{8.10}$$

#### 8.1.1 Mutual Fund Separation Theorem

The theory also implies the so-called *mutual fund separation theorem*. At a high level, we have reduced every tradable position and portfolio to a point in mean-variance space<sup>1</sup>. That is, a pair of numbers completely describes any portfolio

<sup>1</sup>We will move (and indeed already have moved) interchangeably between the labels of mean-variance and volatility-return space. The former is identified from the original optimization problem, while the latter is useful in understanding the geometry of the space of solutions. Related, it is common in practice to refer to volatility-return space as *risk-return space*.

in the model. Given this reduction of dimensions in utility space, one may ask whether we may describe portfolios themselves with fewer parameters; i.e., is there a subset of portfolios which can yield any mean-variance combination an investor desires? The answer is yes. And perhaps not surprisingly you only need two.

For a point on the efficient frontier, we may rewrite (8.7) as

$$w^* = \frac{1}{d} \left( b\Sigma^{-1}1 - a\Sigma^{-1}\mu \right) + \frac{1}{d} \left( c\Sigma^{-1}\mu - a\Sigma^{-1}1 \right) \mu^*,$$

or, simply

$$w^* = \alpha + \gamma\mu^*. \quad (8.11)$$

Notice that in this formulation, the only free parameter in determining a position on the efficient frontier (perhaps as expected) is the expected return,  $\mu^*$ .

Next, suppose we have two points on the efficient frontier,  $(\sigma_1, \mu_1)$  and  $(\sigma_2, \mu_2)$ , or, equivalently, two portfolios,  $\Pi_1$  and  $\Pi_2$ , on the efficient frontier given by

$$\begin{aligned} w_1 &= \alpha + \gamma\mu_1 \\ w_2 &= \alpha + \gamma\mu_2. \end{aligned}$$

Consider a third portfolio,  $w_3$ , lying on the efficient frontier with expected return,  $\mu_3$ . By the linearity of expectation, any portfolio constructed as a linear combination of  $\Pi_1$  and  $\Pi_2$  satisfying

$$a_1\mu_1 + a_2\mu_2 = \mu_3$$

will have expected return  $\mu_3$ . By (8.11), to lie on the efficient frontier, we must also have

$$a_1w_1 + a_2w_2 = \alpha + \gamma\mu_3.$$

This implies, based on the parameterization of  $w_1$  and  $w_2$ , that

$$a_1 + a_2 = 1.$$

A system of equations to identify  $w_3$  as a linear combination of  $\Pi_1$  and  $\Pi_2$  emerges as

$$\begin{pmatrix} \mu_1 & \mu_2 \\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \mu_3 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}, \quad (8.12)$$

which yields solution

$$\begin{aligned} a_1 &= \frac{\mu_2 - \mu_3}{\mu_2 - \mu_1} \\ a_2 &= \frac{\mu_3 - \mu_1}{\mu_2 - \mu_1}, \end{aligned}$$

or

$$w_3 = \frac{\mu_2 - \mu_3}{\mu_2 - \mu_1} w_1 + \frac{\mu_3 - \mu_1}{\mu_2 - \mu_1} w_2. \quad (8.13)$$

This is fairly remarkable.

Under the assumptions of the model, then, any efficient portfolio may be constructed from just two other portfolios on the efficient frontier. The theorem gets its name by assuming that  $\Pi_1$  and  $\Pi_2$  are mutual funds through which all investors can express their mean-variance preferences. Inherent in the usefulness of this theory, however, is the stability of the covariance – an issue we have previously studied and in so doing have observed significant variation, especially in the market impact of dominant eigenvalues. That is, the theorem is interesting for its mathematical implications, but we do not have empirical evidence to pursue its application in practice.

A more thorough discussion of the application of the theory follows at the end of the chapter. First, we present another remarkable result, culminating in what is called the *Capital Market Line*.

#### 8.1.2 The Capital Market Line

So far, we have assumed that all assets were risky. The introduction of a risk-free asset (read zero variance) has dramatic implications. In particular, we will see that in volatility-return space, the efficient frontier may be reduced to a line. Further, the previous mutual fund separation theorem may be formulated between the risk-free asset and a portfolio whose importance we will determine shortly. First, we outline a mean-variance optimization problem when one asset is risk-free.

As before, let  $\mu$  and  $\Sigma$  be the expectation and covariance, respectively, of  $r \in \mathbb{R}^N$ , the stochastic vector of returns of  $N$  linearly independent risky assets. If we consider fully allocated portfolios in these  $N$  assets and the risk-free asset, we have, for  $1'w = w^*$ ,  $r_f$  the return for the risk-free asset, and  $\mu^*$  the expected return of the portfolio of these  $N+1$  assets,

$$\begin{aligned}w^{*'}\mu + (1 - e'w^*)r_f &= \mu^* \\ w^{*'}(\mu - r_f) &= \mu^* - r_f.\end{aligned}$$

As before, we may set up a minimum variance portfolio optimization problem as

$$\begin{aligned}\min_w & \frac{1}{2}w'\Sigma w \\ & (\mu - r_f)'w = \mu^* - r_f.\end{aligned}\tag{8.14}$$

Notice that we have not included the full allocation constraint since it is implied in the expected return requirement.

The Lagrangian of (8.14) is

$$\mathcal{L}(w, \lambda) = \frac{1}{2}w'\Sigma w - \lambda((\mu - r_f)'w - (\mu^* - r_f)),\tag{8.15}$$

which has gradient in  $w$  of

$$\nabla_w \mathcal{L}(w, \lambda) = \Sigma w - \lambda(\mu - r_f).\tag{8.16}$$

The gradient vanishes at

$$w^* = \lambda \Sigma^{-1}(\mu - r_f),$$

and  $\lambda^*$  satisfying the constraints of (8.14) is found by solving

$$w^{*'}(\mu - r_f) = \mu^* - r_f.$$

One may show, and the exercise is left to the reader, that the optimal risky weights are given by

$$w^* = (cr_f^2 - 2ar_f + b)^{-1} \Sigma^{-1}(\mu - r_f)(\mu^* - r_f) \quad (8.17)$$

for the same  $a$ ,  $b$ , and  $c$  as in the preceding section.

The variance of the optimal portfolio in risky and risk-free assets for expected return  $\mu^*$  is found to be

$$\sigma^2 = \frac{(\mu^* - r_f)^2}{cr_f^2 - 2ar_f + b}. \quad (8.18)$$

Assuming that  $\mu > r_f$ , we have that

$$\mu^* = r_f + \sigma \sqrt{cr_f^2 - 2ar_f + b}. \quad (8.19)$$

Notice that, in contrast to (8.10), we now have a *linear* relationship between volatility and expected return. One of two cases may obtain: the line determined by (8.19) may dominate the efficient frontier, being tangent; or, this line is at times above and others below the efficient frontier. But, by construction, the answer is the former (so long as  $\mu > r_f$ ) since (8.14) has as a subset of feasible portfolios those considered in the original formulation (8.1). That is, for the same  $\mu^*$ , the objective function of (8.14) is no bigger than that of (8.1) at the optimal solution. Therefore there exists a single portfolio on both the efficient frontier and the line specified by (8.19). We call this portfolio the *tangency portfolio* and the line connecting the risk-free asset and the tangency portfolio in volatility-return space the *Capital Market Line*.

Next we consider another mutual fund separation theorem in light of the Capital Market Line. In this iteration, we fix the two ‘mutual funds’ as the risk-free asset and the tangency portfolio, with weights for the latter denoted by  $w_T$ .

For a third portfolio lying on the efficient frontier with weights  $w_3$ , we show that its expected return,  $\mu_3 = w_3'\mu$  may be obtained from a combination of the risk-free asset and the tangency portfolio, with the sum of the weights between these two being fully specified and summing to one. Based on the above, this gives that this particular combination lies on the Capital Market Line, reduces volatility as compared to the portfolio with weights  $w_3$ , and maintains the expected return  $\mu_3$ .

Letting  $\mu_T$  be the expected return of the tangency portfolio, we have by (8.17) that

$$w_T = \gamma_0(\mu_T - r_f)$$

with  $\gamma_0=(cr_f^2-2ar_f+b)^{-1}\Sigma^{-1}(\mu-r_f)$ . This gives

$$\mu_T=r_f+(1'\gamma_0)^{-1}$$

since  $w_T$  is on the efficient frontier with sum of weights equal to one.

To relate the expected return of our third portfolio to the risk-free asset and the tangency portfolio, we require

$$a_0r_f+a_1\mu_T=\mu_3.$$

Combining this with the relationship in  $\mu_T$ , we have

$$\begin{aligned}a_0r_f+a_1(r_f+(1'\gamma_0)^{-1})&=\mu_3\\(a_0+a_1)r_f+a_1(1'\gamma_0)^{-1}&=\mu_3.\end{aligned}$$

Requiring  $a_0+a_1=1$ , this further reduces to

$$r_f+a_1(1'\gamma_0)^{-1}=\mu_3$$

so that

$$a_1=(1'\gamma_0)(\mu_3-r_f)$$

and

$$a_0=1-(1'\gamma_0)(\mu_3-r_f).$$

We conclude that the portfolio with weights  $a_0$  and  $a_1$  in the risk-free asset and tangency portfolio results in all of the features set out at the beginning of this construction. Namely, we have reduced volatility while maintaining expected returns, and the solution is to simply identify a mixture of two portfolios<sup>2</sup>.

This is yet another truly remarkable result: in volatility-return space, simple combinations of the risk free asset and the tangency portfolio dominate all other portfolios – even those on the efficient frontier. This is clearly seen in Figure 8.1.2. The punchline of all of this work is that if all investors regard risk and reward purely in terms of mean and variance, then all analysis boils down to determining just what proportion of the tangency portfolio to choose<sup>3</sup>.

We have previously noted caution with respect to reducing equities to their respective time series of returns; the current results extend this caution further. We postpone these thoughts for a bit longer, however.

The tangency portfolio may be identified by an equilibrium argument: namely, if all investors have the same utility, then the tangency portfolio must in fact be the market portfolio of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (4.1). Such an argument

<sup>2</sup>Of course, we have not yet outlined a procedure for identifying the weights of the tangency portfolio, focusing so far only on its defining characteristic.

<sup>3</sup>One additional assumption is that all investors must have the same allocation constraints; viz., the constraints to the optimization problem are identical for all investors. This of course does not obtain in practice.

is a deviation from the approach of this book, however. Instead, we may prove that the tangency portfolio is the very same market portfolio by first assuming that the CAPM model holds and then making the weaker assumption that the market portfolio and tangency portfolio have the same expected return. These assumptions and the previously considered optimization problem identifying the minimum variance portfolio with  $\beta = 1$  in (7.41) may be used to show that the market portfolio and tangency portfolio are one and the same.

#### 8.1.3 A Geometric Interpretation and CAPM

As noted above, we may consider any portfolio as a point in volatility-return space,  $(\sigma, \mu)$ . The mutual fund separation theorem that gave rise to the Capital Market Line may be seen as a maximization of a particular slope. That is, we identified the Capital Market Line as the line emanating from the risk-free asset and going through the tangency portfolio. The slope of the Capital Market Line

$$s_T = \frac{\mu_T - r_f}{\sigma_T},$$

with  $(\sigma_T,\mu_T)$  being the mean return and volatility of the tangency portfolio, then, is the maximum slope possible since it is tangent to the efficient frontier.

The slope for any other choice  $(\sigma_0,\mu_0)$ ,

$$s_0=\frac{\mu_0-r_f}{\sigma_0},$$
 (8.20)

is called the *Sharpe Ratio* for that portfolio. The results above give a clear indication of its importance in the theory; viz., the Capital Market Line focuses on the change in expected return per change in volatility. We have already seen this ratio when considering the low volatility anomaly, however. There we focused on return-per-vol-point to identify attractiveness across deciles of *ex ante* volatility<sup>4</sup>. Here we continue with the geometric focus.

Motivated by these observations, we would like to, for any portfolio,  $\Pi$ , identify  $\frac{\partial\mathbb{E}(r_\Pi)}{\partial\sigma_\Pi}$ . Our previous encounters with CAPM and now the Capital Market Line give some indication of a path forward on this question. In particular, we will work in volatility-return space, and consider convex combinations of  $\Pi$  and the tangency portfolio. Some calculus will yield that  $\frac{\partial\mathbb{E}(r_\Pi)}{\partial\sigma_\Pi}$  is exactly determined by the Capital Asset Pricing Model.

*Proof.* Let  $\Pi$  be identified by  $(\sigma_0,\mu_0)$  in volatility-return space and let the tangency portfolio be given by  $\Pi_T$ , with volatility, expected return pair  $(\sigma_T,\mu_T)$ . Let the stochastic return of  $\Pi$  and  $\Pi_T$  be given by  $r_\Pi$  and  $r_T$ , respectively. A portfolio consisting of a convex combination of  $\Pi$  and  $\Pi_T$  is given by

$$\Pi_\theta=\theta\Pi+(1-\theta)\Pi_T,$$

with stochastic returns

$$r_\theta=\theta r_\Pi+(1-\theta)r_T.$$

Clearly at  $\theta=1$ ,  $r_\theta=r_\Pi$  and at  $\theta=0$  we have the return of the tangency portfolio. Similarly

$$\frac{\partial\mathbb{E}(r_\theta)}{\partial\sigma_\theta}\Big|_{\theta=0}=\frac{\partial\mathbb{E}(r_T)}{\partial\sigma_T}.$$
 (8.21)

This final partial is known based upon our work above, however, as this coincides with the slope of the Capital Market Line; i.e.,

$$\frac{\partial\mathbb{E}(r_T)}{\partial\sigma_T}=\frac{\mu_T-r_f}{\sigma_T}.$$
 (8.22)

We proceed in identifying  $\frac{\partial\mathbb{E}(r_\theta)}{\partial\sigma_\theta}$  by making use of the chain rule. In particular, we have that

$$\frac{\partial\mathbb{E}(r_\theta)}{\partial\sigma_\theta}=\frac{\partial\mathbb{E}(r_\theta)}{\partial\theta}\frac{\partial\theta}{\partial\sigma_\theta}=\frac{\partial\mathbb{E}(r_\theta)}{\partial\theta}\left(\frac{\partial\sigma_\theta}{\partial\theta}\right)^{-1}.$$

<sup>4</sup>A minor quibble may be made. In the previous analysis, we omitted the risk free rate,  $r_f$ . This ratio of return (as opposed to excess return) to volatility is oftentimes referred to as the *information ratio*.

That is, we are left to calculate

$$\frac{\partial\mathbb{E}(r_\theta)}{\partial\theta}$$

and

$$\frac{\partial\sigma_\theta}{\partial\theta},$$

specifically at  $\theta=0$ .

By the linearity of expectation,

$$\mathbb{E}(r_\theta) = \theta\mu_0 + (1-\theta)\mu_T,$$

and so,

$$\left.\frac{\partial\mathbb{E}(r_\theta)}{\partial\theta}\right|_{\theta=0} = \mu_0 - \mu_T. \quad (8.23)$$

The volatility of  $\Pi_\theta$  is similarly derived. We begin by finding the variance,

$$\begin{aligned} \mathrm{Var}(r_\theta) &= \mathrm{Var}(\theta r + (1-\theta)r_T) \\ &= \theta^2\sigma_0^2 + 2\theta(1-\theta)\sigma_{0,T} + (1-\theta)^2\sigma_T^2, \end{aligned}$$

where  $\sigma_{0,T} = \mathrm{Cov}(r_\Pi, r_T)$ . One may show from here that

$$\frac{\partial\sigma_\theta}{\partial\theta} = \frac{\theta\sigma_0^2 + (1-2\theta)\sigma_{0,T} - (1-\theta)\sigma_T^2}{\sigma_\theta} \quad (8.24)$$

so that, at  $\theta=0$ , we get

$$\left.\frac{\partial\sigma_\theta}{\partial\theta}\right|_{\theta=0} = \frac{\sigma_{0,T} - \sigma_T^2}{\sigma_T}. \quad (8.25)$$

Finally, we have that

$$\left.\frac{\partial\mathbb{E}(r_\theta)}{\partial\sigma_\theta}\right|_{\theta=0} = (\mu_0 - \mu_T) \cdot \left(\frac{\sigma_T}{\sigma_{0,T} - \sigma_T^2}\right).$$

And, as already mentioned above, the left hand side is the slope of the Capital Market Line, giving an equation relating  $\mu_0$  and the covariance of  $\sigma_{0,T}$  to the tangency portfolio in volatility-return space:

$$\frac{\mu_T - r_f}{\sigma_T} = (\mu_0 - \mu_T) \cdot \left(\frac{\sigma_T}{\sigma_{0,T} - \sigma_T^2}\right). \quad (8.26)$$

Rearranging terms in the above yields the very recognizable relationship

$$\mu_0 - r_f = \frac{\sigma_{0,T}}{\sigma_T^2}(\mu_T - r_f), \quad (8.27)$$

which is just the expected value of the Capital Asset Pricing Model

$$r_\Pi - r_f = \beta_\Pi(r_T - r_f) + \epsilon$$

with the tangency portfolio taking the place of the market portfolio and under the very mild assumption that  $\epsilon$  is idiosyncratic with zero expectation. Notice that, in particular, we have not assumed any distributional assumptions for the idiosyncratic  $\epsilon$ .  $\square$

In the case that the CAPM model holds with these reduced assumptions on  $\epsilon$  and the market portfolio is put in place of the tangency portfolio as prescribed, then we must have, considering the tangency portfolio as  $\Pi$ ,

$$\mu_T - r_f = \beta_T(\mu_m - r_f).$$

Now, if  $\mu_T = \mu_m$ , then clearly  $\beta_T = 1$ . Based on our previous results identifying the market portfolio with the minimum variance, fully allocated portfolio with  $\beta = 1$ , this implies the market portfolio and tangency portfolio must be the same if the optimization under consideration is performed over all assets in the market.

In the simplest case, then, we may determine the tangency portfolio directly. However, two immediate variations come to mind. First, we may consider optimizations over some subset of securities. Second, we may extend (8.1) or (8.14) to include general linear constraints. In this case, much of the above work still obtains – in particular, a tangency portfolio exists under the same conditions as above – but the identification of the tangency portfolio and market portfolio is restricted to the fairly reduced example just presented. In addition, we will require some new machinery to determine the tangency portfolio from an optimization problem.

We consider the case of identifying the tangency portfolio with general constraints next.

### 8.2 Maximizing the Sharpe Ratio

Based on the preceding section, the importance of the Sharpe Ratio (8.20) is evident. While the original analysis only included an expected return constraint in the derivation, we are now interested in the general case

$$\begin{array}{c} \max_w \frac{w'\mu - r_f}{\sqrt{w'\Sigma w}} \\ Aw = b \\ Cw \ge d. \end{array} \quad (8.28)$$

Additionally, for reasons discussed previously, we will require that there exists a feasible solution with  $w'\mu > r_f$ .

The above formulation does not fit cleanly into any of the optimization problems we have yet considered. To obtain a solution, we will need to modify the objective function through the introduction of some auxiliary variables. We will show that this new problem is equivalent to the original and its solution

will be apparent. For ease of exposition, we first consider the simpler problem

$$\max_w \frac{w'\mu - r_f}{\sqrt{w'\Sigma w}} \quad (8.29) \\ 1'w = 1.$$

Again, we assume that there is a feasible solution that outperforms the risk-free asset in expected returns.

We will show that we may rewrite (8.29) as

$$\min_{(y,\kappa)} \begin{array}{l} y'\Sigma y \\ (\mu - r_f)'y = 1 \\ (y, \kappa) \in \chi^+ \end{array} \quad (8.30)$$

where  $y$  is seen to have the same dimension as  $w$ , and the new variable,  $\kappa$  is a real valued scalar defined through the sets

$$\chi = \{w : 1'w = 1\}$$

and

$$\chi^+ = \left\{(y, \kappa) : \kappa > 0, \frac{y}{\kappa} \in \chi\right\}. \quad (8.31)$$

In particular, if  $(y^*, \kappa^*)$  solves (8.30), then  $w^* = \frac{y^*}{\kappa^*} \in \chi$  and solves (8.29).

*Proof.* The condition that there exist  $w$  in the feasible set such that  $(\mu - r_f)'w > 0$  implies that for  $\kappa$  defined as  $\kappa = ((\mu - r_f)'w)^{-1}$ , may be constrained to be positive in the feasible set. With  $\kappa$  so defined, let  $y = \kappa w$  and note that the objective function in (8.29) may be written in these new variables as

$$\begin{aligned} \frac{w'\mu - r_f}{\sqrt{w'\Sigma w}} &= \frac{1}{\kappa} \left(\sqrt{w'\Sigma w}\right)^{-1} \\ &= \frac{1}{\kappa} \left(\sqrt{\frac{1}{\kappa^2} y'\Sigma y}\right)^{-1} \\ &= \left(\sqrt{y'\Sigma y}\right)^{-1}. \end{aligned}$$

This gives immediately that the original objective function maximization is equivalent to minimizing  $\sqrt{y'\Sigma y}$  over both  $\kappa$  and  $y$  (taking into account the feasible set) and hence equivalent to minimizing  $y'\Sigma y$  over these same variables as in (8.30). We are left then to similarly rewrite the constraints of the original problem.

Before addressing this issue, we must first write  $y$  without a dependence on  $w$ . This is fairly immediate, however, as

$$\begin{aligned} y &= \kappa w \\ &= ((\mu - r_f)'w)^{-1} w \end{aligned}$$

implies that  $(\mu - r_f)'y = 1$ . This constraint, as seen in (8.30), then, ensures the relationship we defined above. With this final piece in place, the requirement  $(y, \kappa) \in \chi^+$  clearly ensures the feasibility sets of the two problems coincide. Hence the two optimization problems are equivalent.  $\square$

One minor quibble may be made that we have not rewritten the original problem in a more familiar form (read with linear constraints). This is indeed the case. Instead we have constructed a so-called quadratic programming problem with a conic constraint, where the details of this distinction are left as an exercise for the reader. It is rather immediate based on the above, though, to see that we may replace the constraint  $(y, \kappa) \in \chi^+$  with just the single constraint  $\kappa > 0$ , giving a fairly simple linearly constrained quadratic programming problem.

The case of general constraints considered in (8.28) is handled similarly. As before, we define auxiliary variables  $\kappa$  and  $y$  and cones,  $\chi$  and  $\chi^+$  and assume there is a feasible solution that exceeds the risk free rate in expected returns. But for the definition of  $\chi^+$ , the problem equivalent to (8.28) is identical to the last formulation. Namely, we have

$$\begin{array}{ll}\min_{(y,\kappa)} & y'\Sigma y \\ & (\mu - r_f)'y = 1 \\ & (y, \kappa) \in \chi^+\end{array}\tag{8.32}$$

with, now,

$$\chi = \{w : Aw = b, Cw \ge d\}$$

and

$$\chi^+ = \left\{(y, \kappa) : \kappa > 0, \frac{y}{\kappa} \in \chi\right\}.\tag{8.33}$$

Further, if  $(y^*, \kappa^*)$  solves (8.32), then  $w^* = \frac{y^*}{\kappa^*} \in \chi$  and solves (8.28). The proof is left to the reader.

Again we have a tidy description of the constraints in (8.32), but note that these do not coincide with our usual presentation. This may be remedied immediately by rewriting  $(y, \kappa) \in \chi^+$  as the trio of linear constraints

$$\begin{array}{rcl}\kappa & > & 0 \\ Ay - b\kappa & = & 0 \\ Cy - d\kappa & \ge & 0.\end{array}\tag{8.34}$$

### 8.3 Portfolio Updates

We have already noted the importance of the global mean-variance optimal portfolio and tangency portfolio above. Here we discuss applying the general procedure of mean-variance optimization to updating a portfolio. While doing so, we will also briefly mention some common types of constraints seen in practice.

Oftentimes when considering the generalization of (8.1),

$$\begin{array}{ll}\min_w & \frac{1}{2}w'\Sigma w \\ & Aw = b \\ & Cw \ge d,\end{array}\tag{8.35}$$

or the general Sharpe optimization problem given in (8.28), it is necessary to work from an already existing portfolio. That is, rather than identifying the optimal weight,  $w^*$ , one must find an optimal update,  $\Delta^*$ , based upon initial weights  $w_0$ .

Focusing on (8.35), we may write the problem in terms of an update to some initial  $w_0$  as

$$\begin{array}{ll}\min_\Delta & \frac{1}{2}(w_0 + \Delta)'\Sigma(w_0 + \Delta) \\ & A(w_0 + \Delta) = b \\ & C(w_0 + \Delta) \ge d,\end{array}\tag{8.36}$$

which of course may be rewritten as

$$\begin{array}{ll}\min_\Delta & \frac{1}{2}\Delta'\Sigma\Delta + w_0'\Sigma\Delta \\ & A\Delta = b - Aw_0 \\ & C\Delta \ge d - Cw_0.\end{array}\tag{8.37}$$

The formulation (8.37) is then a quadratic programming problem in the decision variable  $\Delta$ . A similar procedure may be applied to (8.28), and this is left as an exercise.

It is common to place gross turnover constraints on a portfolio update, or, slightly more sophisticated, to place linear transaction cost constraints on the problem. In either case, we are left with having to work with the absolute value of turnover. This entails having to keep track of the sign of each  $\Delta_i$ ; viz., a gross turnover constraint may be written as

$$\sum_i |\Delta_i| \le \tau$$

for some  $\tau$ .

We may partition  $\Delta$  into a positive and negative part as in our development of linear programming as

$$\Delta = \Delta_+ - \Delta_- \tag{8.38}$$

where  $\Delta_+ \ge 0$  and  $\Delta_- \ge 0$ . In this case, the turnover constraint above becomes

$$\sum_i \Delta_{+,i} + \Delta_{-,i} \le \tau. \tag{8.39}$$

In the presence of turnover constraints, (8.37) is now optimized over a vector of dimension  $3N$  when  $\Delta \in \mathbb{R}^N$ . How exactly this comes about is illustrated below.

We begin by letting

$$\tilde{\Delta}=\left(\begin{array}{ c } \Delta \\ \Delta_{+} \\ \Delta_{-} \end{array}\right),$$

and writing the relationships given in (8.38) and (8.39) as an equality and inequality constraint, respectively. For (8.38), we have

$$[I -I I]\tilde{\Delta}=0,$$

where  $I$  is the  $N\times N$  identity matrix. Gross turnover is handled similarly by writing

$$[0 -1' -1']\tilde{\Delta}\ge-\tau.$$

Notice that we need not include  $\Delta$  in our modified problem since the positive and negative parts as constructed will contain the same information. However, we retain the variable for potential ease of exposition.

The original problem may now be written in these new auxiliary variables:

$$\begin{array}{ c c } \min_{\tilde{\Delta}} & \frac{1}{2}\tilde{\Delta}'\tilde{\Sigma}\tilde{\Delta}+\tilde{w}_{0}'\tilde{\Sigma}\tilde{\Delta} \\ & [A \ 0 \ 0]\tilde{\Delta}=b-Aw_{0} \\ & [C \ 0 \ 0]\tilde{\Delta}\ge d-Cw_{0} \\ & [I -I -I]\tilde{\Delta}=0 \\ & [0 -1' -1']\tilde{\Delta}\ge-\tau. \end{array} \quad (8.40)$$

The determination of  $\tilde{w}_0$  and  $\tilde{\Sigma}$  are left to the reader.

It should be noted that the move to an updating framework from a total portfolio optimization increases the likelihood of the constraint set being infeasible when gross turnover constraints are introduced. This is perhaps more clearly understood from thinking about the problem qualitatively; viz., if the incoming portfolio is not feasible, and a small number of trades are allowed, then it isn't possible to trade to feasibility. One remedy to this type of issue is to increase  $\tau$  in the above until a feasible solution is obtained. This isn't always possible, however, as turnover constraints may be more rigid than others in live trading. Alternatively,  $b$  and  $d$  may be relaxed in turn, but this requires bespoke knowledge of the mandates driving the constraints being present in the first place.

Another way to handle the potential infeasibility of (8.40) based on a particular  $w_0$  and turnover budget  $\tau$  is to introduce so-called slack variables. For example, restricting a new variable  $\gamma$  to be nonnegative, we may modify

$$[Z -1' -1']\tilde{\Delta}\ge-\tau$$

to

$$[Z -1' -1']\tilde{\Delta}\ge-\tau-\gamma.$$

The new variable must be included in the objective function as well as, e.g.,

$$\min_{\tilde{\Delta},\gamma}\frac{1}{2}\tilde{\Delta}'\tilde{\Sigma}\tilde{\Delta}+\tilde{w}_0'\tilde{\Sigma}\tilde{\Delta}+C\gamma$$

for some scalar,  $C$ . This technique generalizes to the case of multiple slack variables where the change to the objective function is  $C\sum_j\gamma_j$  in this case and equality constraints are modified to inequality constraints based on enforcing conditions as  $|c_i(\Delta)|\le\gamma_i$ .

### 8.4 Equivalence of Maximizing Returns

We have so far looked at the problem of minimizing portfolio variance with a set of linear constraints, with particular focus on an expected return constraint. Here we establish the equivalence between this original problem and maximizing returns while constraining portfolio variance. While this is a slightly mundane equivalence (based on the insights already made via the efficient frontier work), it is also one commonly needed in practice as a portfolio manager may have to adhere to mandated risk controls; i.e., a portfolio manager will be interested in identifying the best portfolio opportunity given a maximum bound on risk.

In this spirit, we will prove an equivalence between

$$\begin{array}{ll}\min_w & \frac{1}{2}w'\Sigma w \\ & Aw=b \\ & \mu'w\ge\mu^* \\ & Cw\ge d\end{array}\tag{8.41}$$

and

$$\begin{array}{ll}\min_w & -\mu'w \\ & Aw=b \\ & \frac{1}{2}w'\Sigma w\le\nu^* \\ & Cw\ge d\end{array}\tag{8.42}$$

where we have explicitly broken out the return requirement in (8.41) and modified the objective and similar constraint to obtain (8.42). The parameter  $\nu^*$  has not yet been specified, but the interested reader will likely guess what this value must be. Note, too, that while we have not as of yet worked with quadratic constraints, we will still utilize the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions (7.11), which are again both necessary and sufficient in this case.

We next prove that for  $w^*$  a solution to (8.41), with  $\frac{1}{2}w^{*'}\Sigma w^*=\nu^*$ , then  $w^*$  solves (8.42) with the same  $\nu^*$ .

*Proof.* The Lagrangian of (8.41) is given by

$$\mathcal{L}(w,\delta,\lambda,\eta)=\frac{1}{2}w'\Sigma w-\delta(\mu'w-\mu^*)-\lambda'(Aw-b)-\eta'(Cw-d).$$

We know that at the optimal solution there exists Lagrange multipliers satisfying the KKT conditions

$$\begin{aligned}\nabla_w \mathcal{L}(w^*, \delta^*, \lambda^*, \eta^*) &= 0 \\ Aw^* &= b \\ Cw^* &\ge d \\ \delta^*(\mu'w^* - \mu^*) &= 0 \\ \eta_i^*(C_i w^* - d_i) &= 0.\end{aligned}$$

We also have a Lagrangian for (8.42)

$$\tilde{\mathcal{L}}(\tilde{w}, \tilde{\delta}, \tilde{\lambda}, \tilde{\eta}) = -\mu'\tilde{w} - \tilde{\delta}\left(\frac{1}{2}\tilde{w}'\Sigma\tilde{w} - \nu^*\right) - \tilde{\lambda}'(A\tilde{w} - b) - \tilde{\eta}'(C\tilde{w} - d)$$

and associated KKT conditions at the optimal solution

$$\begin{aligned}\nabla_w \tilde{\mathcal{L}}(\tilde{w}^*, \tilde{\delta}^*, \tilde{\lambda}^*, \tilde{\eta}^*) &= 0 \\ A\tilde{w}^* &= b \\ C\tilde{w}^* &\ge d \\ \tilde{\delta}^*\left(\frac{1}{2}\tilde{w}'\Sigma\tilde{w} - \nu^*\right) &= 0 \\ \tilde{\eta}_i^*(C_i \tilde{w}^* - d_i) &= 0.\end{aligned}$$

To confirm the equivalence we are looking for, we verify that

$$\begin{aligned}\tilde{w}^* &= w^* \\ \tilde{\delta}^* &= \frac{1}{\delta^*} \\ \tilde{\lambda}^* &= \frac{\lambda^*}{\delta^*} \\ \tilde{\eta}^* &= \frac{\eta^*}{\delta^*}\end{aligned}$$

satisfy the KKT conditions for (8.42) when  $(w^*, \delta^*, \lambda^*, \eta^*)$  satisfy the KKT conditions for (8.41).

Since feasibility in the constraints outside of the mean return or variance are identical between the two problems, we are left to confirm

$$\begin{aligned}\nabla_w \tilde{\mathcal{L}}(\tilde{w}^*, \tilde{\delta}^*, \tilde{\lambda}^*, \tilde{\eta}^*) &= 0 \\ \tilde{\delta}^*\left(\frac{1}{2}\tilde{w}'\Sigma\tilde{w} - \nu^*\right) &= 0 \\ \tilde{\eta}_i^*(C_i \tilde{w}^* - d_i) &= 0.\end{aligned}$$

We leave the verification of the gradient vanishing as a problem in the exercises. Looking at the remaining conditions, we know that

$$\eta_i^*(C_i w^* - d_i) = 0$$

for each row of  $C$ , and hence it is immediate that

$$\tilde{\eta}_i^*(C_i\tilde{w}^*-d_i)=0$$

by the definition of  $\tilde{\eta}^*$  and  $\tilde{w}$ . Further, strict complementarity holds. Next, since

$$\begin{aligned}\frac{1}{2}w^{*'}\Sigma w^* &= \nu^* \\ \tilde{\delta}^*\left(\frac{1}{2}\tilde{w}'\Sigma\tilde{w}-\nu^*\right) &= 0,\end{aligned}$$

again with strict complementarity.

Therefore the two problems as constructed have identical solutions, and refer to the same point on the efficient frontier.  $\square$

A third formulation may be considered, motivated by the Lagrangian of the first problem. Here, a parameterization of the efficient frontier is explicit in  $\gamma$ :

$$\begin{aligned}\min_w & \frac{1}{2}w'\Sigma w - \gamma\mu'w \\ & Aw = b \\ & Cw \ge d.\end{aligned}\tag{8.43}$$

The parameter  $\gamma$  is sometimes referred to as an appetite for risk, with the case of  $\gamma=0$  coinciding with the global mean-variance optimal portfolio.

### 8.5 Pitfalls and a Word of Caution

The unconstrained mean-variance problem encountered at the beginning of the chapter is rife with issues in practice, so much so that it the procedure itself has at times been referred to as an ‘error maximizer’ when the sample covariance matrix is used. Some indication that this might be the case was already seen, but in a different context; namely, when the distribution of eigenvalues was considered as in Figure 3.3, we noted that the bulk of the eigenvalues (by count) were near zero, with a handful very large eigenvalues explaining the majority of the variance.

In the present context, this phenomenon leads to stark results. Consider that without loss of generality, we may consider any of the preceding mean-variance optimization problems in an alternative basis. Changing basis to that of the eigenvectors of  $\Sigma$  yields

$$w'\Sigma w = (Qw)'\Lambda(Qw)$$

for some change of basis matrix satisfying  $Q\Sigma Q'=\Lambda=\text{diag}(\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_N)$ . But, we’ve seen that there are several eigenvectors with eigenvalues near zero. Assuming that the  $\lambda_1<\lambda_2<\cdots<\lambda_N$ , then the optimizer will maximize the return of the eigenportfolios  $e_1, e_2$ , etc., if their expected returns are nonzero

since there it perceives that these eigenportfolios have little to no risk. If no exposure constraints are enforced (viz.,  $|w| \le \delta$ ), then the optimizer will view the total allocation constraint in our original problem as a net constraint.

The result of all of this is that when using the sample covariance matrix without informative constraints (especially maximum exposure constraints), the distribution of optimal weights tends toward heavy concentrations in both longs and shorts. This is literally counter to every bit of intuition presented so far that has led to this point.

Luckily, several remedies are available. One in particular has already been alluded to: incorporating constraints greatly mitigates the concentrations issues noted above. On the one hand, this has been seen as simply codifying preferences rather mean-variance optimization as such; i.e., the idea that constraints may resolve issues with the initial problem may be seen solely as the power of the *a priori* intuition of the practitioner imposing those constraints rather than as a boon to the process as such. On the other hand, we will later show that we may view the addition of constraints as a modification of the covariance matrix.

We will also consider alternative modifications of the covariance. Our focus will range from factor models, to so-called shrinkage estimators, to results with origins in random matrix theory.

Before we get to these advances in approach, however, we are left with some intuition that (8.1) is not suitable for practical implementation without due consideration of the input covariance matrix.

1. Focusing on (8.35), write the specific constraints needed to construct a portfolio with gross notional of 2 ( $\sum_i |w_i| = 2$ ), and net notional of zero ( $\sum_i w_i = 0$ ). This will require a similar approach taken in the case of turnover constraints, but without the introduction of  $\Delta$ ; i.e., this is not an update, but a full portfolio optimization.
2. Again using the framework of (8.35), write the constraints needed for a portfolio optimization problem ensuring that net exposure to the value anomaly measured by top and bottom quintile is positive, no short (long) exposure exists in the top (bottom) quintile of value, gross exposure of the portfolio is 2, and net exposure is between -0.2 and 0.2. For notation, let  $\nu$  be the vector of value quintiles; i.e.,  $\nu$  is a vector with values in  $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$  of the same dimension as the decision variable of the problem, with values of 5 indicating ‘high’ value.
3. Generalize (8.40) to robustly handle the case of infeasibility by introducing slack variables in the problem where appropriate. Why must the constant  $C$  noted in this discussion be used? How might one choose the size of  $C$ ?
