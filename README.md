# Portfolio Statistics and Optimization — Reading Notes

Working through Chris Bemis's *Portfolio Statistics and Optimization* (August 2023) 
with an AI companion (Claude via [solveit](https://solveit.fast.ai)), 
capturing the dialog as I build intuition for investment theory.

The dialogs (notebooks) can be read here but are best viewed at solve.it.com, 
which distinguishes cell types by colored highlight. For the most part, 
green (markdown) is the book, red (AI dialog) and blue (code) are my notes and additions.

(That's as far as I've worked through to date.)
