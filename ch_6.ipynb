    "Much of the work we have seen in regression may be framed as examples of unconstrained optimization. That is, the problems obtained solutions by minimizing some loss function; viz., the  $L^2$  norm, or sum of squares. In that setting, we both identified solutions such as the  $\\hat{\\beta}$  of an OLS regression as well as discussed such a solution's distributional properties. Here, we focus on the former task, even while revisiting examples in OLS and a related problem in index replication.\n",
    "\n",
    "The work begins by outlining conditions for a point,  $x^*$ , to be a solution of a minimization problem,  $\\min_x f(x)$ . We then identify useful necessary and sufficient conditions that  $x^*$  must obtain to be optimal when working with a smooth  $f$  [5]. We also establish some attractive properties that convex  $f$  have in the current context.\n",

    "Finally, we discuss Newton's method, an algorithm useful in identifying stationary points. As we shall see, under some assumptions, we may prove convergence of the method to a stationary point when  $f \\in C^2$ . The algorithm provides a template for future work in constrained optimization as well."

For a market tracking portfolio, one may argue that the appearance of negative positions is spurious.

We will see that a parsimonious solution relies on understanding the eigenvalues of the covariance of the returns involved. As a preview: the model results here are sensitive to near-zero eigenvalues. Solutions abound, however. In particular, an immediate and obvious fix is to *constrain* the possible weight sizing available to the model. Another is to ameliorate the eigenvalue just identified. This solution leverages the field of random matrix theory and is a burgeoning area of interest in the field."
