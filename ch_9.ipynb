    "\n",
    "Alternatives to the variance-as-risk measure are ubiquitous, and, as indicated from our previous observations such as the inverse relationship between variance-as-risk and *ex-post* returns, warranted. In this chapter we identify the requirements for so-called *coherent measures of risk*. Following the approach of previous chapters, we do not take these conditions as necessary in any sense, but, rather as a taxonomy of what one might articulate as a reasonable risk measure. For example, at the outset of the text we compared unlevered and levered portfolios and noted that any reasonable measure of risk should account for this intuitive approach. This, among other similar features, is indeed the case for coherent measures of risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "After establishing the standard conditions, we give several examples of potential measures of risk, some of which may fail one or another requirement of being a coherent measure of risk. A few particularly popular risk measures will be formulated as linear programming problems."

    "### 9.1 Definition and Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "We focus specifically on coherent measures of risk from the frame of portfolio positions. Specifically, for a fixed universe of  $N$  securities, we define a portfolio,  $\\Pi$ , as the positions in these assets,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Pi = \\begin{pmatrix} p_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ p_N \\end{pmatrix}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this formulation, we treat the  $p_i$  as nonrandom. It is common to refer to both the portfolio as  $\\Pi$  as well as its vector of positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The performance of a portfolio is subject to some stochastic element. We let\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r = \\begin{pmatrix} r_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ r_N \\end{pmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "denote the performance of the  $N$  assets in our universe, with  $r_i$  corresponding to the  $i$ th asset. We may regard  $r$  as either normalized performance (read percent change) or changes in value measured in the currency of  $\\Pi$ ; in the former case, we often assume that the  $p_i$  are normalized as weights as well, while in the latter,  $p_i$  will denote the position in security  $i$ , irrespective of other positions taken. Where necessary, we will specify which of these interpretations for  $r$  is being used. In contrast to our work in mean-variance optimization, however, we will prefer using positions and changes in security values over returns and normalized positions in the present work and will assume this is the case unless otherwise specified. Of course, there is also an implicit assumption of a unit of time over which  $r$  is evaluated. The profit or loss of the portfolio  $\\Pi$  over a given period is simply,  $\\Pi'r$ , as we have seen previously. Finally, to be consistent with conditions that follow, we will fix the sign of  $r$  so that a positive value indicates a loss for a long (positive) position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before stating the mathematical formulation of what makes a coherent measure of risk, we first give some qualitative motivation. First, we would expect that any reasonable risk measure should respect leverage. That is, a levered portfolio should multiply the risk of its un-levered counterpart. Next, we would want that the addition of a risk-free asset to a portfolio should not add to the risk of the portfolio. This condition will actually be strengthened in what follows. Third, based on all that has preceded, we have some preference for diversification, and we would prefer a risk measure that reflects this. Finally, if one portfolio almost surely exceeds another under all scenarios,  $r$ , then we should like to say that the first is less risky than the second.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these features established, we say\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\rho: \\Pi \\to \\mathbb{R} \\quad (9.1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "is a coherent measure of risk if  $\\rho(\\cdot)$  satisfies the following conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Positive Homogeneity** For  $\\lambda$  a positive scalar,  $\\rho(\\lambda \\cdot \\Pi) = \\lambda\\rho(\\Pi)$ .\n",
    "\n",
    "**Translation Invariance** For  $p_f$  a position in the risk-free asset with profit,  $r_f$ ,  $\\rho(\\Pi + p_f) = \\rho(\\Pi) - p_f \\cdot r_f$ .\n",
    "\n",
    "**Monotonicity** If  $\\Pi_1'r < \\Pi_2'r$  for all instances of  $r$ , then  $\\rho(\\Pi_1) < \\rho(\\Pi_2)$ .\n",
    "\n",
    "**Subadditivity**  $\\rho(\\Pi_1 + \\Pi_2) \\le \\rho(\\Pi_1) + \\rho(\\Pi_2)$ .\n",
    "\n",
    "We have as archetypical examples of risk in portfolio variance and volatility. It should be readily apparent that these examples will not satisfy all of the conditions above. Translation Invariance is immediately an issue as we know\n",
    "\n",
    "variance is translation invariant in the traditional sense; viz., adding a nonrandom scalar to a random variable does not affect the variance of the random variable. Furthermore, Positive Homogeneity gives an indication that volatility may be better suited to the remaining conditions than variance. Continuing this cursory discussion, it may also be apparent to some readers that coherent measures of risk will focus on values of the distribution of loss (which must be denoted as positive in the above framing) rather than the moments of these distributions.\n",

    "#### 9.1.1 Volatility\n",
    "\n",
    "If we define  $\\rho(\\Pi)$  by the volatility of the portfolio loss  $\\Pi'r$ ,  $\\nu(\\Pi)=\\sqrt{Var(\\Pi'r)}$ , or in terms of the inner product and associated norm defined previously,\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\\nu(\\lambda\\Pi)&=||\\lambda\\Pi||_\\Sigma\\\\&=\\lambda||\\Pi||_\\Sigma\\\\&=\\lambda\\nu(\\Pi).\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As alluded to earlier, volatility does not adhere to the Translation Invariance condition of a coherent measure of risk since the inner product defining volatility is translation invariant with respect to nonrandom shifts; viz.,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\\nu(\\Pi+p_f)&=||\\Pi+p_f||_\\Sigma\\\\&=||\\Pi||_\\Sigma\\\\&=\\nu(\\Pi).\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This same reasoning precludes Monotonicity from obtaining for volatility. Consider two identical portfolios but for an additional long position in the risk-free asset in the first portfolio. Clearly, in terms of the positions of the portfolios (and not weights), the first portfolio's losses will always be less than the seconds since the risk-free asset will create a parallel shift in these losses. However, as just shown the risks of these portfolios are equal. More generally, we notice that since coherent measures of risk are location dependent, while volatility and variance are not, this condition will fail in more general cases as well.\n",
    "\n",

    "$$\\begin{aligned}\\nu(\\Pi_1+\\Pi_2)^2 &= \\|\\Pi_1+\\Pi_2\\|_\\Sigma^2 \\\\ &= \\|\\Pi_1\\|_\\Sigma^2 + \\|\\Pi_2\\|_\\Sigma^2 + 2(\\Pi_1, \\Pi_2)_\\Sigma \\\\ &\\le \\|\\Pi_1\\|_\\Sigma^2 + \\|\\Pi_2\\|_\\Sigma^2 + 2|\\Pi_1, \\Pi_2|_\\Sigma \\\\ &\\le \\|\\Pi_1\\|_\\Sigma^2 + \\|\\Pi_2\\|_\\Sigma^2 + 2\\|\\Pi_1\\|_\\Sigma \\cdot \\|\\Pi_2\\|_\\Sigma \\\\ &= (\\|\\Pi_1\\|_\\Sigma + \\|\\Pi_2\\|_\\Sigma)^2,\\end{aligned}$$\n",

    "The above construction gives some guidance in identifying why variance is not Subadditive in the general case. This is left as an exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "In analyzing volatility above, we noted that a coherent measure of risk must be location dependent. One rather immediate candidate, consistent with previous work, might be to define a risk measure based on both expectation and volatility as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\rho_\\gamma(\\Pi)=\\mathbb{E}(\\Pi'r)+\\gamma\\cdot\\|\\Pi\\|_\\Sigma \\tag{9.2}$$\n",

Monotonicity fails in the general case, however, since we have not specified *r* sufficiently to connect the rank ordering of portfolio performance to the values given by  $\\rho_\\gamma$ .\n",
    "\n",
    "This, too, gives some indication of a way to construct a coherent measure of risk from this work. Namely, in the case that *r* has an elliptical distribution,  $\\rho_\\gamma$  is directly related to the percentiles of the loss distribution defined by  $\\Pi'r$ . As a simplified example, let  $r\\sim N(\\mu,\\Sigma)$ . We have that the cumulative density function for portfolio losses, *Y*, is then given by the standard normal cumulative density function,  $\\Phi$ , by\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}F_\\Pi(\\mathbb{E}(\\Pi'r)+\\gamma\\cdot\\|\\Pi\\|_\\Sigma)&=\\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\mathbb{E}(\\Pi'r)+\\gamma\\cdot\\|\\Pi\\|_\\Sigma-\\Pi'\\mu}{\\|\\Pi\\|_\\Sigma}\\right)\\\\&=\\Phi(\\gamma).\\end{aligned}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "We may then reformulate the problem in terms of these percentiles. For example, if we want to look at the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile of portfolio losses, we fix  $\\gamma$  as  $\\gamma=\\Phi^{-1}(0.95)$ . For this  $\\gamma$ ,  $\\rho_\\gamma(\\Pi)$  is the value such that losses will only exceed  $\\rho_\\gamma(\\Pi)$  5% of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Returning to the question of constructing a coherent measure of risk via volatility, we have, finally, that for normally distributed,  $r$ ,  $\\rho_\\gamma$  is a coherent measure of risk since we may now verify that it satisfies Monotonicity. This follows directly from the work we just established since if  $\\Pi'_1 r < \\Pi'_2 r$  for all instances of  $r$ , then, necessarily, the percentiles of the loss distribution for  $\\Pi_1$  are all less than those of  $\\Pi_2$ . Consequently,  $\\rho_\\gamma(\\Pi_1) < \\rho_\\gamma(\\Pi_2)$ .\n",
    "\n",
    "The generalization to elliptical distributions follows this same pattern, and the exercise is left to the reader.\n",
    "\n",
    "A further generalization of the above leads to the concept of Value-at-Risk, which we formally define and analyze in the next example."

    "\n",
    "One of the standard tools for the sampling problem required for  $\\beta$ -CVaR is the theory of copulas, first seen in (3.16). Recall that the copula framework allows for the flexibility of specifying marginal distributions as well as joint distributions.\n",

    "Based on these results, we may construct joint distributions,  $F(\\cdot)$  and marginals,  $\\{F_i(\\cdot)\\}$  based on *a priori* views.

    "5. Following the methodology in Chapter 2, select the fifty largest stocks in the cross-sectional and historical return data on the last date available. Using the full 121 weeks of returns available, simulate 5,000 samples from a Student  $t$  distribution using the sample mean and covariance and five degrees of freedom as parameters. Carry out a  $\\beta$ -CVaR minimization with  $\\beta = 0.95$ . Include a no short sale constraint, maximum position of 5% constraint, and gross notional of 1. Bound the  $\\beta$ -CVaR by the  $\\beta$ -VaR from the sample assuming an evenly weighted portfolio. For the optimal portfolio:\n",
