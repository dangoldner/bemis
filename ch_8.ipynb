    "We arrive finally at mean-variance optimization, a hallmark of modern portfolio theory, having established the statistical and optimization framework needed for a fairly full treatment. In this chapter, we will develop the standard framing for the problem and identify some of its most salient features such as the efficient frontier in mean-variance space. We will also prove a theorem – which, if true, would greatly reduce portfolio management complexity – called the mutual fund separation theorem. We will also establish the capital market line of mean-variance optimization and in so doing we will connect mean-variance optimization to the Capital Asset Pricing Model directly.\n",

    "Merton's mean-variance optimization [22] equates investor risk with portfolio variance. That is, for stochastic returns,  $r \\in \\mathbb{R}^N$ , and fixed portfolio weights,  $w \\in \\mathbb{R}^N$ , the variance of the portfolio is given by  $\\text{Var}(w'r) = w'\\Sigma w$  with  $\\Sigma = \\text{Cov}(r)$ , and this quantity completely determines the risk an investor is taking. In its original formulation, minimizing variance is paired with a requirement of some expected return. Letting  $\\mu = \\mathbb{E}(r)$ , the linearity of expectation gives that the expected portfolio return is  $\\mu'w$ .\n",

    "### 8.5 Pitfalls and a Word of Caution\n",
    "\n",
    "The unconstrained mean-variance problem encountered at the beginning of the chapter is rife with issues in practice, so much so that it the procedure itself has at times been referred to as an ‘error maximizer’ when the sample covariance matrix is used. Some indication that this might be the case was already seen, but in a different context; namely, when the distribution of eigenvalues was considered as in Figure 3.3, we noted that the bulk of the eigenvalues (by count) were near zero, with a handful very large eigenvalues explaining the majority of the variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the present context, this phenomenon leads to stark results. Consider that without loss of generality, we may consider any of the preceding mean-variance optimization problems in an alternative basis. Changing basis to that of the eigenvectors of  $\\Sigma$  yields\n",
    "\n",
    "$$w'\\Sigma w = (Qw)'\\Lambda(Qw)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for some change of basis matrix satisfying  $Q\\Sigma Q'=\\Lambda=\\text{diag}(\\lambda_1,\\dots,\\lambda_N)$ . But, we’ve seen that there are several eigenvectors with eigenvalues near zero. Assuming that the  $\\lambda_1<\\lambda_2<\\cdots<\\lambda_N$ , then the optimizer will maximize the return of the eigenportfolios  $e_1, e_2$ , etc., if their expected returns are nonzero\n",
    "\n",
    "since there it perceives that these eigenportfolios have little to no risk. If no exposure constraints are enforced (viz.,  $|w| \\le \\delta$ ), then the optimizer will view the total allocation constraint in our original problem as a net constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of all of this is that when using the sample covariance matrix without informative constraints (especially maximum exposure constraints), the distribution of optimal weights tends toward heavy concentrations in both longs and shorts. This is literally counter to every bit of intuition presented so far that has led to this point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, several remedies are available. One in particular has already been alluded to: incorporating constraints greatly mitigates the concentrations issues noted above. On the one hand, this has been seen as simply codifying preferences rather mean-variance optimization as such; i.e., the idea that constraints may resolve issues with the initial problem may be seen solely as the power of the *a priori* intuition of the practitioner imposing those constraints rather than as a boon to the process as such. On the other hand, we will later show that we may view the addition of constraints as a modification of the covariance matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also consider alternative modifications of the covariance. Our focus will range from factor models, to so-called shrinkage estimators, to results with origins in random matrix theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get to these advances in approach, however, we are left with some intuition that (8.1) is not suitable for practical implementation without due consideration of the input covariance matrix."

    "### Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How can you be sure that each point on the efficient frontier is uniquely represented by a single portfolio?\n",
    "2. Determine  $a$ ,  $b$ , and  $c$  in (8.5).\n",
    "3. Establish (8.8).\n",
    "4. Use Cauchy-Schwarz to show that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(\\mu'\\Sigma^{-1}\\mu) (1'\\Sigma^{-1}1) - (\\mu'\\Sigma^{-1}1)^2 > 0.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this result to show that the determinant of (8.6) is positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prove (8.17).\n",
    "2. Verify (8.18).\n",
    "3. Why must we assume  $\\mu > r_f$  preceding (8.19) to get the result noted? What happens when  $\\mu = r_f$ ? When  $\\mu < r_f$ ?\n",
    "4. Assume that both the CAPM model holds and that the expected return of the market is the same as that of the tangency portfolio. Prove that the tangency portfolio is the market portfolio.\n",
    "5. Prove (8.24) and (8.25).\n",
    "6. Show that  $\\chi^+$  as defined by (8.31) is a cone. That is, for every  $u \\in \\chi^+$ , and positive scalar,  $\\alpha$ ,  $\\alpha u \\in \\chi^+$ . Show further that  $\\chi^+$  is a convex cone by showing that for any  $u$  and  $v$  in  $\\chi^+$ , then  $\\alpha u + \\gamma v \\in \\chi^+$  for positive scalars,  $\\alpha$  and  $\\gamma$ . How can you use this information to show that (8.30) has a unique global minimum?\n",
    "7. Prove that if  $(y, \\kappa)\\chi^+$  as in (8.33), with  $y$  and  $\\kappa$  defined as in the case of simple constraints, then the feasible sets of (8.32) and (8.28) are the equivalent. Conclude that the two optimization problems are equivalent.\n",
    "8. Prove that the constraints given in (8.34) are equivalent to  $\\chi^+$  coupled with the requirements on  $\\kappa$  for the general Sharpe optimization problem. Rewrite these constraints in matrix notation.\n",
    "9. Write a portfolio updating problem similar to that given in (8.37) based upon the Sharpe optimization problem (8.28).\n",
    "10. Determine  $\\tilde{w}_0$  and  $\\tilde{\\Sigma}$  for the portfolio update problem with turnover constraints.\n",
    "11. Assuming turnover costs are linear in  $\\Delta$ , how would you modify (8.40) to enforce a turnover cost budget of  $\\tau_0$  rather than having a gross turnover constraint?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Focusing on (8.35), write the specific constraints needed to construct a portfolio with gross notional of 2 ( $\\sum_i |w_i| = 2$ ), and net notional of zero ( $\\sum_i w_i = 0$ ). This will require a similar approach taken in the case of turnover constraints, but without the introduction of  $\\Delta$ ; i.e., this is not an update, but a full portfolio optimization.\n",
    "2. Again using the framework of (8.35), write the constraints needed for a portfolio optimization problem ensuring that net exposure to the value anomaly measured by top and bottom quintile is positive, no short (long) exposure exists in the top (bottom) quintile of value, gross exposure of the portfolio is 2, and net exposure is between -0.2 and 0.2. For notation, let  $\\nu$  be the vector of value quintiles; i.e.,  $\\nu$  is a vector with values in  $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$  of the same dimension as the decision variable of the problem, with values of 5 indicating ‘high’ value.\n",
    "3. Generalize (8.40) to robustly handle the case of infeasibility by introducing slack variables in the problem where appropriate. Why must the constant  $C$  noted in this discussion be used? How might one choose the size of  $C$ ?\n",
    "4. In the proof of the equivalence between minimizing variance and maximizing return, the solution depended on dividing by  $\\delta^*$ . How can we be sure that  $\\delta^*$  is not zero?\n",
    "5. Prove that the gradient of the Lagrangian vanishes for the choices of weights and Lagrange multipliers used for (8.42). This completes the needed verifications for the equivalence proof.\n",
    "6. Construct a  $3 \\times 3$  covariance matrix and an expected return vector such that your constructed covariance matrix has a near-zero eigenvalue with positive expected return for the associated eigenportfolio. Solve (8.1) using a solver and determine the weight of the eigenportfolio of the near-zero eigenvalue."
