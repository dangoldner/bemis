    "The normal distribution (and its close cousin the log-normal distribution) dominate much of the financial landscape. One feature we believe should be front and center in understanding these objects is that in any discussion where investors make decisions solely on expected return and variance, there is a belief that other statistical shape measures aren't of concern. In this chapter, we work with density functions to better understand a few distributions that are useful for our future work, common in industry and the literature, and which may be useful in avoiding a myopia of expectation and variance as sole features for inspection.\n",

    "We begin by briefly discussing random variables, and develop the mathematics of cumulative and probability density functions with examples [6]. We look at various statistics including the mean, variance, and percentiles of a cumulative density function, esp. the median, and then continue to example distributions. In so doing, we will compare estimated probabilities based on various density functions to empirical frequencies observed in equity returns, and note many so-called stylized features of equity returns as discussed by Rama Cont [8]; e.g., fat-tails, asymmetry of extreme gains and losses\n",

This metric is the so-called Value at Risk (VaR) of the portfolio, and has found a place in institutional investing and in regulatory requirements. The methodology of constructing rare events and loss distributions is sometimes prescribed, but may be left to the practitioner’s discretion as well. There are features of VaR that are not appealing in some lights, and an extension named Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) ameliorates these issues in large part. Without defining this quantity exactly, the idea behind CVaR as a risk metric is to look at the average loss past the VaR threshold – that is, the center of mass of the area under the curve to the right of VaR.

Put in perspective, a six sigma event would occur one day every 1,388,455 million years. Five times longer than the appearance of anatomically modern humans in Africa.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, what about a 25 sigma event? The probability of such an event is  $6.10 \\times 10^{-138}$ . In terms of years, this would occur one day in  $4.49 \\times 10^{132}$  years. Here’s the thing: the universe is only 13.82 billion years old, so that you shouldn’t see this type of event but once across  $3.2 \\times 10^{125}$  universes [16, 17].\n",
    "\n",

Approximating a human hand at  $0.01 \\text{ m}^2$ , it would be  $3.2 \\times 10^{118}$  times more likely to catch a random ball dropped from space in the palm of your hand than to see a twenty five sigma event.\n",

    "We mentioned in the first chapter that during the Quant Crisis, David Viniar, the CFO of Goldman Sachs, was quoted as saying they were observing 25-standard deviation moves, several days in a row. Connecting this statement to the probabilities just calculated is not done in a pejorative sense. More, it is likely that they had very carefully constructed a very stable and attractive product that was blown out by overcrowding and liquidations. Unfortunately we: 1) may find ourselves inherently referring to the normal distribution and its shortcuts of standard deviation explaining everything even when this is inappropriate; 2) tend to think linearly so that a 25 standard deviation *feels* like six times a four standard deviation move via some heuristics; and 3) do not fully understand the dynamics of equity returns, which are subject to crises and other exogenous effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal distribution, even with the above in mind, has extremely nice properties, not the least of which is that it is overwhelmingly the most likely distribution to assume if you are only given the mean and standard deviation of a random variable. The analogy would be that the normal distribution acts as our first linear approximation to the underlying distributions that we may never know. This does not preclude its use as a tool, but should give us a moment to reflect, especially if leverage is determined via risk estimates based on its use."

We find that the estimated skew is -1.151, indicating that there is more mass to the left of the mean than in a centered distribution; this is only indicative, however, as 51.07% of the log returns are positive, the result being influenced by the extreme moves in the left tail. The sample kurtosis is 29.43, a far-cry from the value of 3 obtained from the normal distribution.

This is mitigated, however, by noticing that the variance of  $T \\sim \\text{St}(0, 1; \\nu)$  is exactly  $\\frac{\\nu}{\\nu - 2}$  for  $\\nu > 2$ .

    "In addition, we may go through the same exercise as before, comparing theoretical and empirical frequencies for fit values of  $\\mu$  and  $\\sigma$ . This is left as an exercise for the reader. In doing this, one sees that both the center and the tails are much better explained by the Student  $t$  distribution than by the normal distribution. Extreme values are less than twice as likely to occur in our historical data set than the fit Student  $t$  density would imply as well: a vast improvement over the previous discrepancy of over 800,000."

Short time scale strategies that center around daily close prices are virtually impossible to execute for two reasons in particular: 1) a massive amount of each day’s trading volume is centered around the closing bell, so that achieving a fill on the exact close price is either very tricky or very expensive; and 2) a significant amount of the variation in stock prices comes between the close and the open (that is, when you can’t trade) so that waiting till the open to get your fills downgrades the strategy to random noise.\n",

Performance over other periods was surprisingly stellar, and the crisis days in August 2007 were outliers for the strategy.\n",

    "Good news: **you don't need deep PDF-integration fluency** for the later chapters. Let me summarize what I found:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ch 2 exercises** (current): Heavy on calculus — proving variance formulas via integration, change of variables, showing oddness kills integrals, deriving log-normal density, etc. This is foundational PDF/integral work.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ch 3-10 exercises**: Almost entirely **linear algebra and optimization**, not calculus on densities. The pattern is:\n",
    "- Matrix manipulations (projection matrices, covariance transformations, Hessians)\n",
    "- OLS proofs (unbiasedness, distributions of estimators)\n",
    "- KKT conditions and Lagrangians\n",
    "- Convexity proofs\n",
    "- Numerical methods (Newton's method, shrinkage estimators)\n",
    "- Portfolio construction problems\n",
    "\n",
    "The Student *t* PDF only reappears substantively in **Ch 4** (where it emerges naturally from the OLS estimator distribution — the ratio of a normal to a χ² becomes *t*) and in **Ch 9** (simulation from Student *t* for CVaR optimization).\n",

    "**Bottom line**: Ch 2's calculus exercises are here to:\n",
    "1. Build intuition about *why* distributions behave as they do\n",
    "2. Ensure you're comfortable with the derivations behind formulas you'll *use* later\n",
    "\n",
    "But the rest of the book treats these distributions as tools — you'll sample from them, compute quantiles, use their properties — rather than deriving them from scratch. Your existing calculus comfort should be plenty."
