    "\n",
    "Equity anomalies are abundant. This statement is both terribly, and purposely, imprecise. What defines an equity anomaly? In what sense are they anomalous? And just how abundant is abundant?\n",
    "\n",
    "Eugene Fama in 1970 wrote *Efficient Capital Markets* [9], a pronouncement that the stock market efficiently disseminates every piece of information available about every stock that is traded into their respective prices. Asserting that no amount of analysis can separate future winners from losers, for, all available information has already been incorporated into the current price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly speaking, the above is the efficient market hypothesis (EMH). In the EMH world, no amount of fundamental analysis (reading balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements) or technical analysis (identifying patterns, real or perceived) will generate excess returns in the long run. Any contradiction to this is an anomaly. Again we are left with an imprecise statement as to what is meant by excess returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider, for example, the chart in Figure 1. Here a one dollar investment is made in each of two securities; the blue line being a market proxy, Standard and Poor's S&P 500 Index. At the end of a ten year period, there is clear 'excess.' But to what end? There is, even without a proper statistical analysis something unappealing in the wild swings and variations in the purported winner. Our sense of caution is not wrong, either, since in this case the winner is simply a leveraged version of the market—returns are  $2\\times$  the un-levered version. This surely can't be what is meant by the impossibility of generating excess returns, and in fact it isn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a somewhat technical treatment is needed. Referring to the figure once more, there is something *riskier* in the leveraged series. Defining risk and its requisite properties has become a seminal issue over the past few decades. At the outset, volatility was tantamount to risk. And as we will see in subsequent chapters, much of the theoretical machinations supporting the efficient market hypothesis will imply that excess returns are a positive function of risk (read volatility). The example above notwithstanding, this is antithetical to what is observed empirically and what will be shown in subsequent chapters. In fact we will exhibit that the market, rather than compensating for risk in the equity markets, punishes risk-holders across almost every measurement.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Staying within the confines of the EMH world, then, what should one do if choosing a good stock is proscribed by theoretical fiat? Buy them all, of course! One of the pivotal contributions to the field in fact belies this very statement. At its heart is a treatment of systemic and idiosyncratic risk which culminates in a familiar refrain: you can't beat the market, and diversification is the key to reducing idiosyncratic risk."

The formulation of the efficient market hypothesis in this book will be a statistical one, with some modification of the standard literature. While we will focus primarily on Merton and Sharpe's Capital Asset Pricing Model [22, 31] and the subsequent Fama-French three factor model [10], we will often eschew their language of risk. Instead, we will use these two models much as the Black-Scholes' option formula is in practice: for an interpretive tool to understand asset allocation and for uniform comparisons.\n",

There are several theoretical consequences to the model, many of which will be discussed later. Presently, though, we obtain that the model gives a single variable by which to compare assets."

Notably that equity returns are not stationary; i.e., the statistical properties needed to obtain a quantity like $\\beta$ above are not the same over various time slices. Calculating a stock's $\\beta$ from 1990 to 2000 will be different than from 2000 to 2010. Or worse, six months prior to, say, the financial crisis of 2008 will differ from six months after. Worse yet, even as we will develop the framework for understanding the statistical distribution of a variable like $\\beta$ (noting that in fact most financial data should be taken as ranges and not point estimates), the movements of the market can violate the assumptions for well-behaved estimators. Put another way, even if we make an expected range for $\\beta$, the market's moves could go outside this range in a heartbeat."

Instead, we note the power of understanding an asset or a weighted portfolio of assets in terms of highly meaningful and understandable exposures within the market. We will also see that models like Fama-French and CAPM will lend themselves readily to portfolio allocation models where understanding the co-movements of assets is rife with estimation error."
