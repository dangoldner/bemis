    "\n",
    "In this chapter, our work in unconstrained optimization is expanded to the case of identifying optima under some set of constraints for the decision variable  $x$ . As in the previous chapter, we begin with some preliminary discussion and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for a point  $x^*$  to be a solution for a class of objective functions. Whereas before this was a fairly straightforward endeavor, here we feel the need to illustrate the problem at hand with a few examples for clarity. After this motivation, we lay out the so-called Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions for constrained optimization and provide a derivation of the first order necessary conditions. In so doing, we also develop some understanding of the associated Lagrange multipliers of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "As was the case for unconstrained optimization, we again emphasize the attractive properties of convex functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the basics in hand, we look at two broad classes of constrained optimization problems: Quadratic Programming with Linear Constraints (QPLC) and Linear Programming with Linear Constraints (LPLC). In each case, we establish standard forms of the problem and give some motivation as to how they might solved algorithmically by utilizing the KKT conditions of the particular problem. In the case of LPLC, we also lightly develop the concept of the dual.\n",
    "\n",
    "We conclude with examples in QPLC and LPLC, ranging from a portfolio optimization problem identifying the market portfolio as the minimum variance portfolio with  $\\beta = 1$  to a regression technique called quantile regression."

We proceed by formulating (7.45) as a constrained quadratic programming problem.\n",

    "To do so, we again introduce auxiliary variables. In the present case, we seek variables,  $z_t$  and  $u_t$ , such that  $|y_t-\\beta'x_t|=z_t+u_t$  and  $z_t$  takes up that portion of the absolute value up to  $C$  and  $u_t$  the remainder.

    "Clearly as  $C\\rightarrow\\infty$ , the above loss function tends towards the standard least squares problem considered extensively already.

The question of how to determine such  $C$  is left to a subsequent chapter."

    "1. Rigorously prove that each optimal Lagrange multiplier in the active set is exactly the sensitivity of the objective function value at the optimal solution when a small change in the constraint value is made.

    "2. What is the impact of a nonzero Lagrange multiplier when the objective function is multiplied by a scalar  $c > 0$ ? What is the impact of multiplying a single constraint function,  $c_i(x)$  by  $c$  (leaving the objective function fixed)? (This result coupled with the previous exercise shows that while Lagrange multipliers may be viewed as sensitivities, they are also scale dependent; i.e., they are not necessarily unitless.)\n",
